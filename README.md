Rock Paper Scissor
Is a simple hand game played between two people, where each player simultaneously chooses one of three options Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The rules are straightforward:

1.Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)
2.Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cuts Paper)
3.Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock)
The game can be implemented in Python using its basic programming constructs. Below is a step-by-step explanation and a sample code of how "Rock, Paper, Scissors" works in Python.

Key Concepts for the Game in Python:
User Input: The player needs to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The Tkinter module: is Python’s standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library. It provides a way to create windowed applications (like desktop apps) that are interactive, with buttons, text boxes, labels, and more. Tkinter is a wrapper around the Tk GUI toolkit, which is one of the most popular cross-platform GUI toolkits available.

Random Choice for the Computer: The computer's choice can be simulated using Python's random module.
Comparison of Choices: The game logic checks the player’s choice and the computer’s choice to determine the winner.
Display Results: The result is displayed showing whether the player won, lost, or tied.
